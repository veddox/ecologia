  Ecologia README
===================

--- THIS IS THE README FOR ECOLOGIA 1.1! ---
 (a readme for version 2 is soon to follow)
	
Ecologia is a graphical ecosystem simulator. Currently it is still very basic,
but hopefully it will soon be expanded to include more and more aspects of a
real ecosystem.

It is written in Java, though no programming knowledge is needed to use it.
Requires Java 7 or higher to be installed.


Further documentation files can be found in the 'doc' subdirectory:

help - A short manual
concepts - Introduction to the concepts of Ecologia
roadmap - Future development plans
TODO - List of things to be done (for developers)
bugs - List of known bugs (fixed and current)
javadoc.html - Complete Javadoc-tm documentation for Ecologia
Ecologia ODD.pdf - A description of the biological model behind
		 Ecologia using the ODD protocol (for biologists)
